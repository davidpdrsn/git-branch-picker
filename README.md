# git-branch-picker

Switching branches is annoying when you have lots of them. This allows you to do
fuzzy search for branches. It even sorts the branches by most recent commit.

## Install

1. Install Rust
2. Install (or update) by running `cargo install --force --git https://github.com/davidpdrsn/git-branch-picker.git`
